## Contents

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `voice_gender.py` | Primary script for training/testing the gender-classification model. |
| `voice_gender1.py` / `voice_gender2.py` | Alternate versions / experiments of the main script. |
| `voice_gender_model.pkl` | The serialized (pickled) trained model used for inference. |
| `Sample_Voice.wav` / `Sample_Voice2.mp3` | Sample audio files used for testing / demonstration. |

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x  
- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `librosa` (or another audio processing library)  
- Any other libraries your scripts import (check the top of each `.py` file)

You can install via `pip`, for example:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn librosa
